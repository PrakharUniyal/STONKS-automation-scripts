# STONKS
Stonks is a unique stock market simulation game made for the Kamand Premier League by E-Cell, IIT Mandi. The motive of the game is to create an environment where players have to bet on the knowledge of their teammates and opponents in order to earn maximum profit by the end of the game. Each player except the team leaders is assigned a predetermined initial value(in this case, we have used the auction prices from the beginning of KPL) and this value changes depending on the performance of the player through the game. Team leaders, on the other hand, are the investors who have the ownership of the stocks of their teammates and some currency to buy shares from the stocks of opponent team players. As a result the change in the value of a player affects the wealth of all of his/her stakeholders and not only his teamâ€™s leader. To make the game fair, every team will start with an equal net wealth(currency+stock).
